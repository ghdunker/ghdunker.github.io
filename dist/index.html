<h2>GithubIo Test</h2>
    <hr />
     <p>It's nice to be getting a grip on things to some degree. I might as well start documenting what I've been doing so I don't just forget about it. 
      Forgeting is always easier than I think it is, and re-learning everithing is draining.</p>
    <p>I don't even understand how to update the page. You'd think the easiest thing to do on github pages would be to update changes..</p>
